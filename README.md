# Overview

This web app was created to give me experience with creating servers and working with NodeJs.

The app that I wrote is a pizza survey. It is setup so that a user gives feedback on their pizza order. After giving feedback, the user submits their feedback by hitting a button. Once feedback is received, the user is taken to a thank you page that tells them that their order has been received.

Below is a video demonstration of the web app.

# Web Pages

I created five different pages, but three of them are complete. The user has the ability to switch between each of the different pages with the navigation links at the top of each page. The most dynamic page is the survey page. This page allows the user to type in a variety of information and submit it. After the user submits the information, they are taken to a thank you page. If a user types in a url address that is not listed, they are taken to a custom 404 error page. 

# Development Environment

The development environment that was used for this app was Visual Studio Code.

This web app was made with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nodemon and express were installed and used in combination with NodeJS.

# Future Work

* More content needs to be added to the home and about pages.
* Support for MongoDB needs to be added so that each time the survey is taken, the results are stored in a database.
* More CSS needs to be added to each of the HTML pages.
